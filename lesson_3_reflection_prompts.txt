When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For sharing things and for using several devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have more control of the merges. The GitHub repository may be updated by another person and its changes could not be appropiate.
